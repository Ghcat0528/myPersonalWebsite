      As you saw previously, I am a fan of cats... but what else is there to
      know about me?
    </h2>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>I worked in fast food for around 2.5 years now. I am very quick to learn
        the POS systems and I have great customer service skills. I worked as a supervisor
        while working for DQ and learned how to control drawers and be responsible 
        for money. Managing my crew and breaks was also something I became good at.
        Overall, I'm a quick learner and a good team player!
